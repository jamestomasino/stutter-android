This directory contains reference-only code from the Stutter browser extension.

Purpose:
- Document the original timing logic and word handling semantics.
- Serve as a behavioral reference for the native Android implementation.

Rules:
- This code must not be imported, executed, or depended on.
- No JavaScript, DOM, or browser APIs from this code are to be replicated.
- Platform-specific behavior must be implemented natively per SPEC.md.
- If reference behavior conflicts with SPEC.md, SPEC.md wins.
